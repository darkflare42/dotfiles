# dotfiles
My Collection of dotfiles for easily moving between workspaces.

I use the following git tools in my workflow:

* git cli and aliases for quick work with git
* [git-town](https://www.git-town.com/) to optimize my git workflows
* [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for a nice terminal ui for git, if I want to quickly see modified files and perform quick stashes on select files only
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for more complex git stuff like cherry picking, three-way-merges and more
